        "- **Maya** – the subtle play of appearances, the veil between potential and actual  \n",
        "- **Prakriti** – nature in motion, the dynamic unfolding of phenomena  \n",
        "- **Akasha** – the space or field in which all things exist  \n",

        "These were not formulas, but ways of **training the mind to notice patterns and possibilities**.  \n",

        "> Before circuits, algorithms, or qubits, we first need to **learn to see reality in this way** — to think like nature allows.\n"
